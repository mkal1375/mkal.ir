## 3 law

- Write a failing test for a feature.
- Write just enough code needed to pass the failing test. Quality no matter.
- Refactor your code.

## Why?

- Short coding cycle => easier debugging.
- Make your production code more readable and understandable.
- Write test after write code is hard.
- Write test after code leaves holes in test suit.
- Make refactoring a pease of cake.we are confident about our code base and confidently refactor our code.

## Challenges

- How write test before code?
  - start developing on paper or you head not you code editor!\
    after that you can easily write tests first.
- it's wast of time!
- TDD make debugging, refactoring, scaling easier and faster in the future.
